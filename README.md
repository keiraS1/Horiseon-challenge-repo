# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

The purpose to this project was to refactor starter code. I made sure that there was accessibility within the code so it was easier to understand the webpage. I also made sure the links were all in check so that the webpage was functioning and complete. Both HTML and CSS were improved to increase the functionality of the site.
